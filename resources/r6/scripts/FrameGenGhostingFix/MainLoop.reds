// Thanks to djkovrik and psiberx for help and redscript snippets, Snaxgamer for his AutoVehicleCamera Switch mod from which a method of wrapping certain events has been inspired. JackHumbert for the Let There Be Flight mod I took bike parts names from. The code is also inspired by danyalzia's contribution to the Ghosting Fix mod (the first functioning script, thank you!)
