# FrameGen Ghosting 'Fix' Preem Compatibility Edition - ArchiveXL mod for Cyberpunk 2077
Limits ghosting behind some moving 3D objects caused by modded FSR3 frame generation in Cyberpunk 2077. Achieves that by putting almost invisible HUD masks that block frame generation from presenting in certain parts of a screen.

**Improved compatibility with other mods compared to the 'classic' version.**

This repo's goal is to serve as a small, literal repository for some modules of the mod only that will be updated with time. I'll keep publishing all files and releases on Nexus for now.

# Requirements
+ Cyberpunk 2.12+
+ [redscript](https://github.com/jac3km4/redscript) 0.5.17+
+ [Cyber Engine Tweaks](https://github.com/maximegmd/CyberEngineTweaks) 1.31.0+
+ [ArchiveXL](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-archive-xl) 1.14.3+

# Intended results
Since 4.0.0-alpha, thanks to the major change in how masks are projected (uses the game's world space-to-screen space method, vehicle's position and camera data to project and transform masks in real-time), the mod is usable with FSR3 FG ON in lower framerates (30+ fps interpolated 60+ fps e.g.).
