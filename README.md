# FrameGen Ghosting 'Fix' mod for Cyberpunk 2077
Limits ghosting behind some moving 3D objects caused by modded FSR3 frame generation in Cyberpunk 2077 by putting almost invisible HUD masks that block frame generation from presenting in certain parts of a screen.

# Requirements
+ Cyberpunk 2.12+
+ [redscript](https://github.com/jac3km4/redscript) 0.5.17+
+ [Cyber Engine Tweaks](https://github.com/maximegmd/CyberEngineTweaks) 1.31.0+

# Intended results
Given the way mod impacts the image shown on a screen, there must be at least 45 base fps before turning FSR 3 frame generation on to achieve acceptable perceived smoothness.
